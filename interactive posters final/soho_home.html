		Designer boutiques, fancy chain stores and high-end art galleries make trendy SoHo a top shopping destination, especially for out-of-towners. Known for its elegant cast-iron-facades and cobblestone streets, the neighborhood is also an atmospheric backdrop for fashionable crowds clustering at high-end restaurants and nightlife hotspots. During the day, street vendors sell everything from jewelry to original artwork.

	<div class= "history" >
	The area between Canal and Houston Streets was rural until the early 19th century, when it became a residential neighborhood. In the 1850s, the area grew into a fashionable district, and Broadway was lined with stores like Lord & Taylor, Brooks Brothers, and Tiffany & Co.—along with posh hotels, theaters, and casinos (and infamous brothels on the side streets!).

	By the 1870s, residents and nightlife had moved uptown. Textile and dry-goods factories sprang up in their place.

	But industry left the area throughout the early 20th century. By the 1950s, the desolate neighborhood was known as “Hell’s Hundred Acres.”

	In the 1960s, artists, who’d been priced out of Greenwich Village, moved into SoHo’s abandoned industrial lofts and converted them into art studios and homes. An avant-garde artists’ community flourished, producing galleries, exhibitions, and performances of new theater, dance, music and video.

	Gentrification soon followed. The (expensive!) neighborhood is now teeming with luxury condos, high-end retailers, art galleries, and stylish bars and restaurants.
