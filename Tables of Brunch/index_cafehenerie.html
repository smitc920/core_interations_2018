      <p id="text">Meet Pietro Nolita: a boldly themed (read: very pink) subterranean den for healthy-leaning Italian. It’s open now for waffles in the morning and fresh pasta in the evening, with lunch to come in a couple weeks.

	Here’s how it’ll go here. You’ll walk up to a baby-pink-painted facade on Elizabeth Street—a pink neon sign loudly declaring its presence. You’ll head down into the dining area and take it all in: pink walls, pink banquettes, pink neon lights. The occasional succulent (hey, not pink). You’ll remember that a couple of fashion industry vets are responsible, which will explain the particularly beautiful crowd and soon-to-be-robust Instagram geotag.

	Now, depending on what time you come through, you’ll be working with things like soft-scrambled-egg crostini and coffee-infused waffles with mascarpone, or fusilli with ricotta salata and broccoli flowers, or cauliflower with spicy lamb sausage. You can’t really go wrong.
