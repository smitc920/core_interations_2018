      <p id="text">These days, it seems like a restaurant is only deemed worthy of a visit if the food is Instagrammable. While We Were Young, a tiny jewel box of a restaurant in N.Y.C.'s West Village, doubles down on this theory with pastel interiors and picturesque dishes that are almost too pretty to eat ("almost" being the operative word). The charming, brightly lit space nods to owner Bradford Dunigan's favorite surf spots: the bar is designed to resemble a wave in his hometown of Fort Lauderdale, Fla. and the millennial pink velvet couches are the same color as the sand in Eleuthera, an island in the Bahamas. Thankfully, in this particular case, expectation meets realityâ€”the menu does not disappoint.</p>
