      <p id="text">The Butcher’s Daughter is a plant-based restaurant, cafe, juice bar and “vegetable slaughterhouse."  We treat fruits and vegetables as a butcher would meat: We chop, fillet and carve fresh produce into healthy vegetarian dishes and press them into pretty juices.  
	<br>
      <br>
	  Our three locations serve breakfast, lunch, dinner and weekend brunch. We take pride in our daily-changing menu, which is 100% vegetarian, and mostly vegan and gluten-free. We can always prepare substitutions for most dietary restrictions.</p>
