      <p id="text">Sunday in Brooklyn is a neighborhood restaurant that cares deeply about what and who we serve, offering breakfast, brunch, and dinner 7 days a week.
      <br>

		The three-story sun-drenched corner building offers a multitude of experiences for each season and time of day. In the warmer months, guests bask in the rooftop garden, sidewalk cafe or the open-air kitchen which extends the outdoors throughout the ground floor. In the cooler months, wood-burning ovens in each dining space, provide warmth and social gathering places.
